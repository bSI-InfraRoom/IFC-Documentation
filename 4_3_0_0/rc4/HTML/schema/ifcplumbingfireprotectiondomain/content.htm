<h3 class="std">7.6.1 Schema Definition</h3>
<p>The <i>IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain</i> schema forms part of the Domain Layer of the IFC Model. It extends the ideas concerning building services outlined in the <i>IfcSharedBldgServicesElements</i> schema. It defines concepts in the domain of plumbing and fire protection.</p>
<p>The scope of the <i>IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain</i>, in conjunction with other building services related schemata, is the provision of plumbing and fire protection services to buildings.</p>
<p>In the case of plumbing, the scope includes for the provision of services external to the building up to the final manhole at which connection is made to the public drainage/sewage service provision. Particular exceptions to support building code checking requirements are made as outlined below.</p>
<p>In the case of fire protection, the scope includes for all services from the point at which a fire authority service is connected or the point at which the statutory water provider terminates the public connection.</p>
<p>In particular, <i>IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain</i> schema supports ideas including types of:</p>
<ul>
<li>sanitary element concerned with personal and public hygiene,</li>
<li>trap on waste pipelines to prevent backflow and odor transmission,</li>
<li>interceptor to capture unwanted liquid and solid waste materials and prevent their passage into drainage pipelines,</li>
<li>waste disposal unit,</li>
<li>cowl terminating ventilation and rainwater pipes at their highest elevation,</li>
<li>automatic and manual terminal point that can be activated to extinguish fire,</li>
<li>hydrant that provide a source of water for hoses in the event of fire or other need for a temporary water supply.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are deemed to be out of scope of the <i>IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain</i> schema at this time:</p>
