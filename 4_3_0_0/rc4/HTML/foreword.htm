    <li>Neutral and independent, and therefore not beholden to any group or company, whether software suppliers, building companies, architects or others, or indeed governments;</li>
    <li>Open and transparent, because the processes by which bSI operates need to be clear and understood by all to demonstrate its independence and neutrality;</li>
    <li>A not-for-profit organisation, meaning that any profits it might make from commercial or quasi-commercial activities are used for non-commercial purposes such as  developing standards.</li>

   <p>buildingSMART develops open standards for Building Information Modeling, open BIM. The standards deal with data models, processes and terms. The <em>Industry Foundation Classes</em> IFC specification constitutes buildingSMART's specification for the buildingSMART data model. Property terms, defined in IFC, are linked to terms defined in the buildingSMART data dictionary.</p>
   <p>buildingSMART liaises with the International Standardization Organization ISO, regional and national standardization bodies for developing international, regional and national standards. The <em>Industry Foundation Classes</em> IFC specification is registered as ISO 16739. buildingSMART works actively as a A-liaison organization with ISO/TC 59/SC 13. Further editions of IFC will be submitted to ISO/TC 59/SC 13/JWG 12 for acceptance as next addendums or editions of ISO 16739.</p>
