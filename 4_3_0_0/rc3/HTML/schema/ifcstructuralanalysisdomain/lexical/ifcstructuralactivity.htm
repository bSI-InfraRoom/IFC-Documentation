<details open="open"><summary>Entity definition</summary><p>The abstract entity <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> combines the definition of actions (such as forces, displacements, etc.) and reactions (support reactions, internal forces, deflections, etc.) which are specified by using the basic load definitions from the <i>IfcStructuralLoadResource</i>.</p>
<p>The differentiation between actions and reactions is realized by instantiating objects either from subclasses of <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralaction.htm">IfcStructuralAction</a> or <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralreaction.htm">IfcStructuralReaction</a> respectively. They inherit commonly needed attributes from the abstract superclass <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span>, notably the relationship which connects actions or reactions with connections, analysis members, or elements (subtypes of <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralitem.htm">IfcStructuralItem</a> or <a href="../../ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcelement.htm">IfcElement</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>NOTE  Instances of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> which are connected with an <a href="../../ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcelement.htm">IfcElement</a> are subject to agreements outside the scope of this specification.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="note">
<p>NOTE  The semantics of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> are only fully defined if an activity instance is connected with exactly one structural item.

<p><strong><strong>Coordinate Systems</strong></strong>:</p>
<p>The following coordinate systems are distinguished:</p>
<ul>
<li>The so-called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralanalysismodel.htm">IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</a>. This coordinate system is established by an <i>ObjectPlacement</i>. (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the <a href="../../ifckernel/lexical/ifcproject.htm">IfcProject</a>'s world coordinate system.)</li>
<li>The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member). This coordinate system is established by a <i>Representation</i> in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralitem.htm">IfcStructuralItem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Representation items in topology representations are always given within the <i>ObjectPlacement</i>, i.e. in so-called global coordinates (global with respect to the <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralanalysismodel.htm">IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</a> to which this activity belongs).</p>
<p>Locations of the load objects in the <i>AppliedLoad</i> attribute (if of type <a href="../../ifcstructuralloadresource/lexical/ifcstructuralloadconfiguration.htm">IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration</a>) are always given in local coordinates.</p>
<p>Directions of the load objects in the <i>AppliedLoad</i> attribute refer to global or local coordinates according to the <i>GlobalOrLocal</i> attribute.</p>
<p>The <i>ObjectPlacement</i> and <i>Representation</i> are sometimes not explicitly instantiated; instead they may be implied as described below. Global and local coordinate systems are then determined in the same way as with explicit placement and representation.</p>
<p><strong><strong>Topology Use Definitions</strong></strong>:</p>
<p>Instances of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> which are connected with a structural item of same dimensionality, i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>a point action or reaction connected with a point item (<a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralpointconnection.htm">IfcStructuralPointConnection</a>),</li>
<li>a curve action or reaction connected with a curve item (<a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralcurveconnection.htm">IfcStructuralCurveConnection</a>, <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralcurvemember.htm">IfcStructuralCurveMember</a>), or</li>
<li>a surface action or reaction connected with a surface item (<a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralsurfaceconnection.htm">IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</a>, <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralsurfacemember.htm">IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</a>) and which acts on the entire surface of the item and is not specified by isocontours</li>
</ul>
<p>shall not have an <i>ObjectPlacement</i> nor a <i>Representation</i>. It is implied that the placement and representation of the <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> is the same as the ones of the <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralitem.htm">IfcStructuralItem</a>.</p>
<p>Instances of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> which are connected with</p>

<li>a surface item (<a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralsurfaceconnection.htm">IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</a>, <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralsurfacemember.htm">IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</a>) and act on a point or on a curve or on a part of the surface of the item</li>
</ul>
<p>shall have a topology representation as specified below. It includes a placement and a product representation. The <a href="../../ifcrepresentationresource/lexical/ifcproductrepresentation.htm">IfcProductRepresentation</a> shall be given by an item in a <i>Representation</i> of type <a href="../../ifcrepresentationresource/lexical/ifctopologyrepresentation.htm">IfcTopologyRepresentation</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>shall have a shape representation as specified below. It includes a placement and a product representation.

Shape representation and topology representation may be combined.</p>
<p><strong>Local Placement</strong></p>
<p>The local placement for <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> is defined in its supertype <a href="../../ifckernel/lexical/ifcproduct.htm">IfcProduct</a>. It is defined by the <a href="../../ifcgeometricconstraintresource/lexical/ifclocalplacement.htm">IfcLocalPlacement</a>, which establishes a global coordinate system which shall be common to all items and activities in an <a href="../../ifcstructuralanalysisdomain/lexical/ifcstructuralanalysismodel.htm">IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Topology Representation</strong></p>
<p>Instances of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> which act on parts of a surface item shall have a topology representation given by a face with underlying surface geometry, <a href="../../ifctopologyresource/lexical/ifcfacesurface.htm">IfcFaceSurface</a>, which should be the single item of <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items</i>. The surface establishes a local coordinate system of the activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The origin of surface parameters u,v is the origin of the local coordinate system.</li>
<li>The local x and y directions follow the tangents on the surface and are in parallel with and directed like u and v respectively.</li>

<p>Instances of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> which act on a curve on a surface item shall have a topology representation given by an edge (<a href="../../ifctopologyresource/lexical/ifcedge.htm">IfcEdge</a> or subtype), which should be the single item of <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items</i>. The curve geometry shall be compatible with the surface geometry of the connected item. In conjunction with this surface, the curve establishes a local coordinate system of the activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>The origin of the curve parameter u is the origin of the local coordinate system.</li>
<li>The local x direction follows the tangent on the curve and is directed like u.</li>
<li>The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal of the connected surface item.</li>
<li>The local x,y,z directions form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.</li>
</ul>

<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Reference'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'Edge'</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Instances of <span class="self-ref">IfcStructuralActivity</span> which act on a single point on a curve or surface item shall have a topology representation given by an <a href="../../ifctopologyresource/lexical/ifcvertexpoint.htm">IfcVertexPoint</a>, which should be the single item of <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items</i>.
