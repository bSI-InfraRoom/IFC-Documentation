<h2 class="std">6.2 IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</h2>
<h3 class="std">6.2.1 Schema Definition</h3>
<p>The <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> schema in the interoperability layer defines basic concepts required for interoperability primarily between Building Service domain extensions, notably <i>IfcHvacDomain</i>, <i>IfcPlumbingFireProtectionDomain</i>, <i>IfcElectricalDomain</i> and <i>IfcBuildingControlsDomain</i>. This schema includes concepts such as basic type and occurrence definitions for flow and distribution systems and property sets for common building service scenarios such as fluid-flow properties, electrical properties, and space thermal properties.</p>
<p>Figure 281 illustrates the concepts of type, occurrence and performance. Types are specializations of <a href="../ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcdistributionelementtype.htm">IfcDistributionElementType</a> while occurrences are specializations of <a href="../ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcdistributionelement.htm">IfcDistributionElement</a>. A third theme, defined in the <i>IfcControlExtension</i> schema, relates to the performance characteristics of an occurrence using instances of the <a href="../ifccontrolextension/lexical/ifcperformancehistory.htm">IfcPerformanceHistory</a> entity.</p>
<p>A type can have zero or many occurrences. Each occurrence can have many performance history entities associated with it, allowing data that is specific to a certain phase of the lifecycle to be captured and maintained throughout the life of the dataset.</p>

<p>The <i>IfcSharedBldgServiceElements</i> schema specializes building services concepts symmetrically for occurrences and types, with the <i>primary</i> functional role of the entity determining its classification into the following generic concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distribution Chamber</strong>: a formed volume used in a distribution system, such as a sump, trench or manhole.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Conversion Device</strong>: a building systems device that converts energy from one form into another such as a boiler (combusting gas to heat water), chiller (using a refrigeration cycle to cool a liquid), or a cooling coil (using the phase-change characteristics of a refrigerant to cool air).</li>
<li><strong>Flow Controller</strong>: a device that regulates flow within a distribution system, such as a valve in a piping system, modulating damper in an air distribution system, or electrical switch in an electrical distribution system.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Fitting</strong>: a device that is used to interconnect flow segments or other fittings within a distribution system, such as a tee in a ducted system that branches flow into two directions, or a junction box in an electrical distribution system.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Moving Device</strong>: a device that is used to produce a pressure differential in a distribution system, such as a pump, fan, or compressor.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Segment</strong>: a section of a distribution system, such as a duct, pipe, or conduit.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Storage Device</strong>: a device used for the temporary storage of a substance (solid, liquid, or gas) such as a tank, or the voltage potential induced by the induced electron flow (a battery).</li>
<li><strong>Flow Terminal</strong>: acts as a terminus or beginning element in a distribution system such as a ceiling register in a ducted air distribution system, a sink in a waste-water system, or a light fixture in an electrical lighting system.</li>
<li><strong>Flow Treatment Device</strong>: a device used to change the physical properties of the medium, such as an air, oil or water filter (used to remove particulates from the fluid), or a duct silencer (used to attenuate noise).</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the domain schemas where types and occurrences are further elaborated using <i>PredefinedType</i> enumerations for examples of the range of supported concepts within these broad classifications. If a new type is needed within this classification, extend using the ElementType attribute. However, if a completely new concept is required that does not fit within this classification, use instances of the generic <a href="../ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcdistributionelementtype.htm">IfcDistributionElementType</a> and <a href="../ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcdistributionelement.htm">IfcDistributionElement</a> entities for the type/occurrence objects as needed.</p>
<p>Occurrences in a distribution system are typically coupled together using instances of <a href="../ifcsharedbldgserviceelements/lexical/ifcdistributionport.htm">IfcDistributionPort</a>. This is also where concepts such as mass-flow properties are applied based on performance characteristics. Refer to the <a href="../ifcsharedbldgserviceelements/lexical/ifcdistributionport.htm">IfcDistributionPort</a> documentation within this schema for further elaboration on coupling together components in a distribution system and tracking the flow characteristics across the port boundaries.</p>
