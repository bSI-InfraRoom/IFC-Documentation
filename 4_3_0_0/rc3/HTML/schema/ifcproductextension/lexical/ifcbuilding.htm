<details open="open"><summary>Entity definition</summary><p>A building represents a structure that provides shelter for its occupants or contents and stands in one place. The building is also used to provide a basic element within the spatial structure hierarchy for the components of a building project (together with site, storey, and space).<br>
NOTE Definition from ISO 6707-1:<br>
Construction work that has the provision of shelter for its occupants or contents as one of its main purpose and is normally designed to stand permanently in one place.<br>
A building is (if specified) associated to a site. A building may span over several connected or disconnected buildings. Therefore building complex provides for a collection of buildings included in a site. A building can also be decomposed in (vertical) parts, where each part defines a building section. This is defined by the composition type attribute of the supertype <i>IfcSpatialStructureElements</i> which is interpreted as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>COMPLEX</strong>: building complex</li>
<li><strong>ELEMENT</strong>: building</li>
<li><strong>PARTIAL</strong>: building section</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="self-ref">IfcBuilding</span> is used to build the spatial structure of a building (that serves as the primary project breakdown and is required to be hierarchical). The spatial structure elements are linked together by using the objectified relationship <a href="../../ifckernel/lexical/ifcrelaggregates.htm">IfcRelAggregates</a>. Figure 150 shows the <span class="self-ref">IfcBuilding</span> as part of the spatial structure. It also serves as the spatial container for building and other elements.<br>
NOTE Detailed requirements on mandatory element containment and placement structure relationships are given in view definitions and implementer agreements.</p>

<p>Systems, such as building service or electrical distribution systems, zonal systems, or structural analysis systems, relate to <span class="self-ref">IfcBuilding</span> by using the objectified relationship <a href="../../ifcproductextension/lexical/ifcrelreferencedinspatialstructure.htm">IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure</a>.
Figure 151 describes the heights and elevations of the <span class="self-ref">IfcBuilding</span> . It is used to provide the height above sea level of the project height datum for this building, that is, the internal height 0.00. The height 0.00 is often used as a building internal reference height and equal to the floor finish level of the ground floor.</p>
<ul>
<li>base elevation of building provided by: <i>IfcBuilding.ElevationOfRefHeight</i>, it is usually the top of construction slab.</li>
<li>base elevation of terrain at the perimeter of the building provided by: <i>IfcBuilding.ElevationOfTerrain</i>, it is usually the minimum elevation is sloped terrain</li>
<li>total height of building, also referred to as ridge height (top of roof structure, e.g the ridge against terrain): provided by BaseQuantity with Name=&quot;TotalHeight&quot;</li>
